Given a weighted undirected graph, you are required to find the minimum spanning tree in the
graph using Primâ€™s algorithm.

Input: \
Your program will be tested against multiple test cases. Each test case begins with two
integers n and e, representing the number of vertices and edges. The next e lines represent the
vertices that are connected by an edge and the weight of that edge.

Output: \
For each test case, print the sum of weights on the edges of the minimum spanning tree
and the corresponding edges with their weights.

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| --- | --- |
| 4 5 <br /> 0 1 10 <br /> 0 2 6 <br /> 0 3 5 <br /> 1 3 15 <br /> 2 3 4 | Edge 2-3 has a weight of 4 <br /> Edge 0-3 has a weight of 5 <br /> Edge 0-1 has a weight of 10 <br /> MST = 19 |
