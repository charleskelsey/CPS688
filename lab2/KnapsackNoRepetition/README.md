John enters a candy shop and in his hand is a very light-thin bag. He is given 20 mins to collect
as much candy as possible, but he needs to make sure that the bag doesn’t tear apart. There’s a
fixed number of candies in the shop – each with its own weight and sentimental value. Of course,
his goal is to put as many candies in the bag as possible while also maximizing the number of
best-quality candies so that he can enjoy the treat during the weekend. Plus, he doesn’t want to
share the candy with anyone since the candy placed in the bag is of the most value with respect
to him.

But John needs your help! So, can you be kind and help him choose the candy he’s required to
put in the bag and the ones he’s supposed to keep at the store?
