The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two
queens attack each other.

The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column.
When placing a queen in a column, you should check for clashes with already placed queens (no
more than one Q in the row and column).

See the example below.

Input: your input should take the number of matrix size N. your matrix is a zeros matrix.
