**Problem 1 - N-Queens** \

**Problem 2 - Acyclic Graph** \
Given an undirected graph, you are required to check if the graph has a cycle.

Hint: consider using BFS/DFS

Input \
Your program will be tested against multiple test cases. Each test case begins with two integers
n and e, representing the number of vertices and edges. The next e lines represent the vertices
that are connected by an edge.

Output \
For each test case, print “no” if the graph contains a cycle; else print “yes”

| Sample Input | Sample Output |     
| --- | --- |
| 6 6 <br /> 0 1 <br /> 0 3 <br /> 1 2 <br /> 2 4 <br /> 3 4 <br /> 3 5 | no |

| Sample Input | Sample Output |     
| --- | --- |
| 6 6 <br /> 0 1 <br /> 0 2 <br /> 0 3 <br /> 1 4 <br /> 2 5 | yes |
