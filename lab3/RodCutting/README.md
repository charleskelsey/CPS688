Given a rod of steel, you need to cut it into pieces in a way to optimize the total revenue. The
decision is where to cut the rod given that different piece lengths have different revenue.

Formally,

Given a rod of length n inches and a table of prices p[i], i=1,2,...,n, find the maximum revenue
r[n] obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

Rod lengths are integers

For i=1, 2,...,n we know the price(revenue) p[i] of a rod of length i inches.

| Length i | 1 | 2 |
| Price p[i] | 1 | 5 |
