**Problem 1 - Boyer-Moore Substring Search** \
Implement the Boyer-Moore substring search algorithm in Java.

Input \
Your program will be tested against multiple test cases. Each test case includes the text and the
pattern.

Output \
For each test case, determine the position(s) of the pattern(s) found in the text.

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| --- | --- |
| Enter the text: Hello World <br /> Enter the pattern: World | Pattern World found at index 6 |
| Enter the text: ATAACGGCTAATA <br /> Enter the pattern: ATA | Pattern ATA found at indices 0, 10 |

<br /> <br />

**Problem 2 - Rabin-Karp Substring Search** \
Implement the Rabin-Karp substring search algorithm in Java (Las Vegas version, see lecture
notes for details). Test your program as you did in Problem 1.
